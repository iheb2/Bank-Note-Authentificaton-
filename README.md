## 📝 Description
- Using Randem Forest Classifier for building the  model then creating  the APi and testing it in Postman 
- Deploying the Model Using Flask (Flasgger)
- Writing and building the model on a docker container 
- Deploying the  model using StreamLit library

## ⏳ Dataset
-  Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images."
